# GoCamp
View campgrounds from all over the world!
GoCamp! is a web-application where users can find,  create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account as all user profiles are maintained with a NoSQL database 
This project was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication across the entire platform.
